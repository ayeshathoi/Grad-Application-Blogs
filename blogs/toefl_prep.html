  <h2 id="h_4">Requirements</h2>
    <p>
        1. Passport <br>
        2. ETS Account Creation and TOEFL Registration <br>
        3. TOEFL Test Fee $205 - payment has to be done by Credit Card <br> 
        4. Take printed copy of registration and Passport on the test day <br> <br>

        For starters, you should register for the TOEFL exam before preparing. 
        <b>14 days with two hours each day are enough for the exam.</b>
        It will boost your seriousness and commitment to the exam. <br> <br> 
        <b>Center Selection</b> <br>
        In the registration process, you will be asked to select a test center. Good Centers : 
        <ul>
            <li>AAA Center, Banani</li>
            <li>Luminedge, Dhanmondi</li>
        </ul>

        While US Software Limited is near to Panthapanth, sometimes the environment is not suitable for the exam.
        On my test day, while I was in the listening section, they started drilling the wall, which hampered my listening scores. 
        On the other hand, on my friend's test day, it was all good. In my words, it depends on your luck.

    <h2 id="h_3">Guidelines</h2>
    <p>
        First of all, take a monthly subscription of Testglider after registering your exam. It helps a lot. If you take monthly subscription before registering, you won't have access of the question after 1 month.<br><br>
        1. <b>Reading</b> <br>
        - Don't read whole passage when it starts<br>
        - Question difficulty is higher than testglider/ets <br>
        - Reading has summarization questions in each passage. To answer them, write/understand the overall idea of each paragraph. <br>
        - In test day, time goes faster, so practice as if your time is 28 minutes. <br>
        - Don't spend too much time on a single question. <br><br>

        2. <b>Listening</b> <br>
        - In the real test, talks are in much higher speed than ets/testglider. <br>
        - You can listen youtube video with 1.5x speed<br>
        - Take notes while listening. <br> <br>

        3. <b>Speaking</b> <br>
        - Record your voice and listen to it. <br>
        - "My_Speaking_Score" website uses speechrater which is used to grade in real test. In that case, you need to buy subscription. <br>
        - Watch a video on which factors are included for grading the speaking [Speed, pause, fluency etc.]. <br>
        - Make a template. <br>
        - <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OS7h-nHWnVeTWcueNAqzlv21DS20XPCC/view" target="_blank">My Speaking Template</a>
        <br> <br>

        4. <b>Writing</b> <br>
        - Write about 300 words for the task 1 and 135 words for second one<br>
        - Make a template <br>
        - Check your grammar mistake in grammarly. Otherwise, silly mistakes can hamper your score. <br>

    </p>

    <h2 id="h_5">TOEFL Question Difficulty Level</h2>
    <p>
        I found reading section a bit harder than Testglider. Time goes too fast in this section. <br> 
        Lectures in listening were a bit faster than Testglider lecture speed. <br>
        But speaking and writing are quite similar to Testglider. <br>
        Grading is also similar to Testglider. <br>
