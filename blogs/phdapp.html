        <h2 id="h_2">Disclaimer</h2>
        <p>PhD application is a confusing, frustrating, and unique journey filled with many variables. There is no
            telling what might happen. After getting through to the other side (although the real challenge is
            completely ahead of me, hehe), I thought I should document it all somewhere; maybe it could be of use to
            someone else. But a disclaimer before you read any more: what worked for me may not work for you at all.
            There are too many factors at play here; no 'one formula for PhD admission' exists. This is solely based on
            my own experience.
            <strong>These are just my suggestions which may not be right for you.</strong>
        </p>
        <p style="color:red;">I wrote this to help anyone who is thinking about applying to a PhD program. I want to
            help as much as I can, but as you will soon find out, PhD is insane and I honestly do not have time to reply
            to texts, even though I really want to. So, if you have any questions to ask me directly, please go through
            this document thoroughly first and be absolutely sure that the answer cannot be found here. Also, for a lot
            of this, you have to use your own intuition like I did. So, only ask me questions if you absolutely need to,
            and please forgive me if I fail to reply (even if you can't forgive me now, you definitely will after you
            start your own PhD haha)</p>

        <h2 id="h_4">The Basics</h2>
        <p>There are two semesters when a PhD program begins, Fall (August) and Spring (January). Usually most programs
            admit students with financial aid during Fall, which is why most people target the Fall semester. The
            application deadlines for Fall semesters are usually around December 15 of the previous year. For Spring
            semesters, the deadlines are around August 15. Admitted PhD students usually receive full tuition waiver +
            monthly stipend in the form of either a research assistantship (RA) under a professor, or a teaching
            assistantship (TA). If a university really wants a student, they may offer them extra fellowships on top or
            instead of the RA/TA funding.</p>
        <p>
            Each application to a university will require an application fee. Typically, people apply to 8-12
            universities. The application fee for East Coast schools can range from $60 to $100 USD, while West Coast
            schools may ask for a whopping $155 USD per application. Sending GRE score to each university also costs $35
            USD, while sending TOEFL score costs $25 USD. Many universities offer application fee waivers based on proof
            of financial hardship or attendance at selected programs/conferences. I received many fee waivers because of
            my attendance at the GHC conference (only for women). So if you're a female CS undergrad student, <span><a
                    href="https://ghc.anitab.org/attend/scholarships/">take a look at here</a>. </span>
        </p>
        <p>
            To apply to a PhD program, you’ll need the following components as part of your application:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Undergraduate Transcript (You should be a graduated student or soon to be)</li>
            <li>Statement of Purpose (This is an essay containing your research plans + prior relevant research work.
                This is also where you’ll list the names of professors you want to work with.)</li>
            <li>Three Letters of Recommendation (From people who have been your direct academic/research/work
                supervisor. The number varies, it’s most commonly 3)</li>
            <li>GRE (strictly optional and mostly unnecessary)</li>
            <li>TOEFL or IELTS (compulsory)</li>
            <li>Personal Statement (depends on program)</li>
            <li>CV</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Each and every component plays an important part in your application. The strength in one may make up for the
            weakness in others. I’ll talk about each component as it comes up. I have tried to organise everything as a
            timeline, so you know what you should be doing and when.</p>
        <h2 id="h_5">T-1.5 Years</h2>

        <p>
            So, what will be the most important factor in your application? A great CGPA? Excellent GRE, TOEFL scores?
            Publications? While these are definitely awesome things to have, they cannot guarantee your admission alone.
        </p>

        <p>
            The one thing that can increase your chances of admission the most is, <i>alignment of interest and
                experience with a professor</i>. That is, having a good amount of research experience in a specific
            area, and finding a professor who is interested in the same area (ofcourse, the professor should also be
            looking to hire new students). The "good amount" can be different for different fields. For more competitive
            fields like ML, CV, NLP, it can mean having published first-authored papers in top conferences. In my case,
            I had two major research projects in security. None of them were published at the time of my application.
        </p>
        <p>
            To obtain said research experience, you should look for projects to be involved in, in your field of
            interest. A good starting point is your undergrad thesis.
        </p>


        <h3 id="h_6">Choosing your undergrad thesis</h3>
        <p>It is almost impossible to completely be sure that you will want to do a PhD in the same field before
            choosing your thesis. Heck, I didn’t even understand half the words of the topic when I chose mine. However,
            your thesis is a research project you will spend a year on. It doesn’t matter if you can accomplish
            something new or achieve state of the art results with your thesis. Most undergrad thesis are, well: stupid.
            It’s supposed to be. But your thesis makes you familiar with the recent works in a field by literature
            reviews, work with a specific problem for a long time and identify future directions. These things make your
            undergrad thesis a significant strength in your PhD application. Again, and I cannot stress this enough: <i>
                professors mainly care about your research experience that matches their own interests.</i> If you
            eventually decide to change fields, your undergrad thesis will no longer be a strong point in your
            application. So, try to choose your undergrad thesis wisely. One idea is: You can visit the websites of top
            universities in the US, find the faculty members in your department of interest, check out a few of their
            papers to just get an idea of what they have been working on recently. It's okay if you don't understand the
            topics. Just know the names of the topics. Look for keywords listed in their papers. This is just an idea -
            I did not do this myself. I had zero clue, and chose my thesis for two reasons, 1) because I was interested
            in systems/security, and 2) because it was a collaboration project. I thought I could get 2 LoRs from one
            project, which I did.</p>
        <h3 id="h_7">Choosing research projects</h3>
        <p>To make your application strong, you need as much relevant research experience as possible. The key word here
            is - ‘relevant’. For example, if you’re applying to security, your published paper in bioinfo will not
            matter very much. So, look for research projects in your field. Here, one of the application components
            should be mentioned:</p>
        <p>The first component you should work towards is the letters of recommendations, or LoRs. To get LoRs, you need
            to be involved in research with at least 3 researchers.</p>
        <p>Usually a lot of people just get LoRs from their thesis supervisor + two course teachers who don’t know them
            very well. However, the ideal and most effective LoRs come from people who are reputable researchers in your
            field + have direct research experience with you + on projects that are relevant to the field you are
            applying to + and ofcourse, have good things to say about you.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In my case, I am grateful to receive LoRs from the following people:</p>
        <p>1. My undergrad thesis supervisor (One LoR must be from your undergrad school, most preferably your thesis
            supervisor, if you’re applying to the same field as your thesis.)</p>
        <p>2. My undergrad thesis collaborator (Research Officer (Cybersecurity), National Research Council, Canada.)
        </p>
        <p>3. Collaborator in another research project in security (Visiting Assistant Professor, MIT)</p>
        <p>4. One of my course teachers (It is wise to manage four recommenders in case you need a backup)</p>
        <p>A LoR from a well-known figure within the academic community (in your field) in the US, can be everything. In
            my case, multiple professors directly mentioned to me that they were impressed by the third LoR (from MIT),
            as they were familiar with his work. I was connected with him through the <a
                href="https://www.fatimafellowship.com/">Fatima Fellowship</a> program. &nbsp;</p>
        <p>So, try to be involved in different research projects in and outside of your school, collaborating with
            different people. Again, ideally, these projects should be directly related to the field that you are
            applying to.</p>
        <h2 id="h_8">June 2023</h2>
        <p>This is when I took my TOEFL exam. It’s not necessary to take it so soon, many people took their TOEFL in
            September/October. This is basically a compulsory English proficiency test. It does not require too much
            prep, so it’s good to take it out of the way sooner than later.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Mushtari-Sadia/TOEFL-prep">
                    <span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204);">Mushtari-Sadia/TOEFL-prep: How did we prepare for our TOEFL

                </a>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>When registering for the TOEFL, you have the option to select four universities to which you can send your
            scores for free. Try to pick four safe choices- places you know that your chances of applying are high.</p>

        <p>Some universities waive the TOEFL/IELTS requirement if you can upload a document containing proof that the
            official language of instruction of your undergraduate institution was English. BUET provides a certificate
            called "Medium of Instruction", which you can obtain by applying in the "Other Certificates" section in
            BIIS. While this can save you some money (since you have to send your GRE/TOEFL scores to each institution
            incurring separate charges), I do not recommend skipping your TOEFL test by relying solely on this
            certificate.</p>
        <h2 id="h_9">July 2023</h2>
        <p>Create a CV and a personal website highlighting your research experience and accomplishments. For reference:

            </a>
        </p>
        <p>This is also the time when you should start exploring and listing professors, universities.</p>
        <p>These websites may help:</p>
        <p>1.
            <a target="_blank"

            </a>
        </p>
        <p>Go through the faculty pages of individual websites of the universities to find professors in your field.
            Look for newly joined assistant professors, they are most likely to hire new PhD students. Comparatively
            more senior professors also look for new students sometimes. If they are looking for new students, they
            usually put it up on their websites. Save the links in a google sheet neatly.</p>

        <p><strong>Note</strong> the department of the professor when you're listing them. For example: I mailed two
            professors at Penn State, without noticing that one is affiliated with the CS department, and another with
            the IST department. Both departments conduct research in security, and I could apply to only one department.
            You will have to write the names of at least three professors with whom you want to work with in your SOP,
            and in most cases, all three professors will be sent your application. If you apply to, suppose the CS dept,
            and write the name of a professor who is in the IST dept, you are wasting one name.</p>

        <h2 id="h_10">August 2023</h2>
        <p>This is the time when you should start emailing professors. This is not a part of the formal application
            process, so some people skip this step, and directly apply to the program in December. This is very risky,
            as high-ranked universities get thousands of applications each year, and there is very little chance that
            they will pay attention to your application/your application will stand out in the central review process.
            To get a professor’s attention, you must reach out to them early and preferably before others.</p>
        <p>For example, I only got into universities where I previously reached out to a professor and got a positive
            response. I received straight rejections from universities where no professor replied to me/I didn’t reach
            out to anyone.</p>
        <p>Carefully craft an email to a professor before sending. Go through their website beforehand, some professors
            put up specific instructions on how you should mail them. Get an overall idea about their interests.</p>
        <p>People usually say you should read a bunch of papers of a professor and come up with something smart and
            analytical to say about those, before emailing them. I did not find this suggestion practical. First of all,
            I did not find it feasible to read years worth of research and come up with a smart question about them in a
            few hours. Secondly, do professors really want you to ramble about their past work? Those are already
            completed research projects.</p>
        <p>They want NEW ideas from you, they want you to work on NEW projects. They want to know about YOU! So focus
            most on how you can present your research most effectively. Ofcourse, that doesn’t mean they don’t want you
            to prove your interest in working with them. So, go to their google scholar page and include two of their
            recent papers that are most aligned with your own interests in the mail. You can use tools like pdf.ai to
            quickly read the papers (or just read the abstract + last paragraph of introduction + conclusion). You can
            write a few sentences about the papers, but I would not put too much effort on this part.</p>

        <p>Choose the ‘schedule send’ option in gmail to send all the emails on Monday evening, which is Monday morning
            in the US. You can also send the emails on Tuesdays to Thursdays, but do not send them on weekends.</p>
        <p>Do not get frustrated if you don’t receive responses. Keep sending emails. I mailed about 36 professors,
            received around 12 replies, and finally got 6 offers. One of my friends sent over 40 emails and got like two
            responses, and she got into a top university as well. There is no rule for this. Most professors will NOT
            reply to your email, and that’s okay.</p>
        <p>If you do get a reply, there are three type of responses:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>“Your background seems a strong fit, particularly your work in … is interesting. I encourage you to
                apply!” (or something like this) - this is a very positive response. The professor is interested in you.
            </li>
            <li>“Thank you for reaching out to me. I encourage you to apply”. - This is a generic response, the
                professor is probably sending this to everyone who is emailing them. Even though this does not indicate
                that they are particularly interested in you, it can mean that they are looking to hire new students,
                otherwise they would not tell you to apply.</li>
            <li>“I’m not sure if I’m going to hire new students. You can apply.” - Not a very good response. It’s best
                if you don’t include their name in your application.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The best time to mail professors is August to mid October, but I’ve mailed professors until late November.
            So, keep mailing. The professors from whom I eventually received admission offers, all responded positively
            to my emails.</p>

        <p>This is when I gave my GRE exam. I regretted taking the GRE, because most universities don’t even consider
            GRE in their admission process anymore. Professors do not care about GRE at all. If you have a decent CGPA,
            I strongly suggest not going through this unnecessary hassle. For me, it was a complete waste of time and
            money.</p>
        <p>However, if you do decide to take the GRE to be safe, one helpful tip: look up the institution code for GRE
            of four universities that you are planning to apply to before going to the exam venue. Also, check if the
            university actually considers GRE in their admission process or not. After taking the exam, you will have
            the option to add the codes of four universities where you can send your scores for free. Like TOEFL, they
            don't let you do this while registering for the exam.</p>
        <h2 id="h_12">October 2023</h2>
        <p>Time to start finalising universities. Go through the websites of the universities and start listing required
            application materials. Many universities offer application fee waivers based on some criteria. I received
            fee waivers from 8 universities by showing financial hardship or attendance in the <span><a
                    href="https://ghc.anitab.org/attend/scholarships/">GHC conference</a>. </span>(<a target="_blank"

                    style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204);">Read this to learn more about fee waivers</span></a>). </p>
        <p>I also listed everything on a <a target="_blank"

            </a> which came in very handy.</p>
        <p>Also, you can start writing your SOP during this period. Some universities ask for a personal statement along
            with your SOP. The main difference between the two is, SOP should be all about your research, and personal
            statement can be about the challenges you've faced in life/other accomplishments. Each university looks for
            different things in the essays, and they mention what they want in their websites. Here are some helpful
            links for SOP writing:</p>

            </a>
        </p>
        <p>While writing: Keep a specific purpose in mind for each paragraph, and make each sentence mean something. Do
            not write any irrelevant/unnecessary sentences. For each of your research experience, remember to
            specifically include your personal contributions + outcome of the project + possible future directions. Do
            not use ChatGPT or AI tools for writing - just use them for proofreading.</p>
        <p>There are GAAP programs which will arrange SOP reviews for you. You can also ask your seniors to review your
            SOP for you.</p>

        <p>My personal statement: (this is required by some universities, but I do not think this carries much weight
            for PhD applicants. This maybe more important for undergrads. However, the specific guidelines for writing
            personal statements are usually provided on the websites of universities)&nbsp;</p>

        <p>You should also email your recommenders during this period to formally ask them if they would provide LoRs
            for you in your upcoming applications. They may ask you to send them a draft. Prepare the drafts too. While
            writing LoR drafts: try to write concrete facts about your contribution in the project with the recommender.

        <h2 id="h_15">January 2024</h2>
        <p>Professors should reach out to you during this period for interviews. I got a total of 9 interviews, 3 during
            the mailing period (before submitting applications), and the other 6 in December-January.</p>
        <h4 id="h_16">Preparing for the interview</h4>
        <p>Create a portfolio slide. <span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);">For reference:
            </span>
            <a target="_blank"
                href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/12W3ZnisvNggLKX3sCF9egqa4C01PvG2hKsnb-8BGF10/edit?usp=sharing">
                <span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204);">my portfolio slide</span></a>. The slide should mainly include
            your major research projects. Include a summary page for each project first, then pages that delve into more
            details.
        </p>
        <p> Get familiar with the professor's research. Again, you don't need to fully understand or memorize any of
            their work. Just skim three or four of their papers, go through their website to get an understanding of the
            domain of their work. Before you get an admission offer, the interview is about you, not them. So you need
            to be prepared to talk about you, not about them.
        </p>
        <p> Prepare yourself to talk about your research in accordance with the slide, revise your work so you can
            answer questions from them. It's understandable if you don't know the professor's work, but it is not
            acceptable if you cannot answer questions from your own work. So focus on being prepared on that area.
            Organize your thoughts. Also, it will be very impressive if you can talk about some problems you want to
            work on in future. For example, after talking about my thesis, I told the professors - 'I faced $these$
            limitations during my thesis, and saw that there is a lack of research/solutions in $these$ specific
            problems. If $this$ could be done, $this$ would solve $that$ problem. I want to work on that in future'. The
            professors will not hold you to actually work on those problems in future. But it demonstrates your
            capability of critical thinking.</p>
        <h4 id="h_17">During the interview</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Always turn on your camera.</li>
            <li>Greet the professor. They will generally ask you to start by introducing yourself. At this point, ask if
                it's okay if you share a slide.</li>
            <li>Introduce yourself after sharing your screen. Your name, your education, current profession and field of
                interest will do.</li>
            <li>First, present a short summary (a few sentences about what the problem was, what you did and what was
                the result) of your most highlighted research project. For me it was my undergrad thesis. Then ask them:
                do you want to hear more details? If they say yes, then delve deeper into the details. Otherwise, it
                will be very boring if you just go on talking and talking. Ask their permission before starting to talk
                about anything.</li>
            <li>When you're presenting a specific project, the professor might ask you questions from them. Try to
                answer those questions as confidently as possible. Remember your personal contributions. This is a good
                point to bring up future directions of the project you want to work on.</li>
            <li>After all this, the interview should naturally flow and take it's own course. You don't need to finish
                the whole slide. In my case, I did not need to talk about more than two projects in any of the
                interviews.</li>
            <li>The professor may ask you, why do you want to do a PhD? Why are you interested to work with me? Prepare
                your answers to these questions beforehand. The second question is a good point to bring up their papers
                that you found interesting.</li>
            <li>The professor may also ask you: do you have any questions for me? Utilize this to know more about them,
                their current research projects, their intention of taking new students, etc. While asking about current
                research projects, it will be great if you try to ask questions to understand the projects. Don't worry
                about "sounding dumb" or "asking smart and insightful questions". Just ask whatever comes to mind. I
                usually keep on doing "why? why? can you explain again?" like a toddler to my own advisor. PhD is all
                about asking questions.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="h_18">February - March 2024</h2>
        <p>You should start receiving offers during this period. This is a very difficult time. Try to be patient.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <p> I'm not sure if I want to do a PhD. I can't decide. How can I be sure?</p>
                <p>- I get this question a lot, and honestly, I can't help with this very much. I myself wasn't always
                    sure, but eventually I knew I liked being in school, I wanted to do a thing called research where
                    you get to work on a different range of challenging problems, and I wanted to eventually become an
                    expert on something. You know when you know. If you aren't sure PhD is for you, you can take some
                    time before you decide. Do not rush this decision. However, remember that it's hard to be a 100%
                    sure about anything. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p> What do I write as a reply to this email from a professor? </p>
                <p> - I feel like such a hypocrite saying this, because I myself bugged my seniors asking this question
                    a lot (shoutout to Adiba apu, love you forever and ever), but, you should actually use your own
                    intuition to write these replies. In most cases, just say thank you and move on. No need to
                    overthink that much. Again, there is no exact format in doing these. Do whatever feels right to you.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p> Would you review my mail/SOP/resume?</p>
                <p> - If I have the time, absolutely! This is the correct thing to ask me about directly. Don't ask
                    me/anyone else what to write, write something first and then you should ask someone to review.
                    Again, if I have the time, I'd be happy to! Also, there are many resources I have shared in the
                    October 2023 section for writing materials. Check those out!</p>
